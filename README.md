In recent years, Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) have proven to perform better than existing methodologies for image segmentation task. In this project, we aim to explore two state-of-the-art Deep learning architectures, UNet and ResNet, for the image segmentation task. We evaluate their performance against two unsupervised segmentation techniques Naive threshold and Otsu's threshold on Data Science Bowl 2018, cell microscopy nucleus dataset. We have proven the belief to be true that UNet like FCN model performs well in this task. We have also discussed the challenges and factors that affect the poor performance of ResNet architecture.


The project contains two ipython notebooks 
- DataGeneration that superimposes all the asks in the dataset into a single mask
- SpotNuclieSpeedCure that contains implementation of different methodologies
